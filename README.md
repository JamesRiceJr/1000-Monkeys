# 1000-Monkeys
"The Infinite Monkey Theorem Simulator" (Hobby Project)

Have you heard of the thought experiment that 1,000 monkeys typing on typewriters could eventually write all the works of William Shakespeare?
This is a lighthearted hobby project to simulate the results of that thought experiment and explore the capabilities of the streamlit Python package (docs.streamlit.io).
